# How to Bind a Report to a Microsoft Access Database Using CustomSqlQuery in Code


This example creates the data source that retrieves data from the .MDB file with the SQL query created from SQL string, and displays data in a simple report created at runtime.

The [SqlDataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.DataAccess.Sql.SqlDataSource) instance is created at runtime with the connection string that specifies the MDB file location. The data source needs a query to retrieve data. In this example, a query is the [CustomSqlQuery](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.DataAccess.Sql.CustomSqlQuery) instance created from a SQL string. The newly created query is added to the [SqlDataSource.Queries](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.DataAccess.Sql.SqlDataSource.Queries) collection. 

A report is the [XtraReport](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XtraReport) class instance that contains a [Detailband](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.DetailBand) and a [Label](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRLabel) control. Depending on the [Data Binding mode](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/119236/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/use-expressions/data-binding-modes), the control uses the [DataBindings](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRControl.DataBindings) or the [ExpressionBindings](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRControl.ExpressionBindings) property to bind to data.

Use the report's [DataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XtraReportBase.DataSource) and [DataMember](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XtraReportBase.DataMemeber) properties to assign the data source to the report.
