# How to Bind a Report to a Microsoft Access Database Using CustomSqlQuery in Code


This example creates a data source that retrieves data from an .MDB file with a SQL query created from a SQL string, and displays data in a simple report created at runtime.

The [SqlDataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.DataAccess.Sql.SqlDataSource) instance is created at runtime with the connection string that specifies the MDB file location. The data source needs a query to retrieve data. In this example, a query is the [CustomSqlQuery](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.DataAccess.Sql.CustomSqlQuery) instance created from a SQL string. The newly created query is added to the [SqlDataSource.Queries](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.DataAccess.Sql.SqlDataSource.Queries) collection. 

A report is the [XtraReport](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XtraReport) class instance that contains a [Detailband](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.DetailBand) and a [Label](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRLabel) control. Depending on the [Data Binding mode](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/119236/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/use-expressions/data-binding-modes), the control uses the [DataBindings](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRControl.DataBindings) or the [ExpressionBindings](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRControl.ExpressionBindings) property to bind to data.

Use the report's [DataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XtraReportBase.DataSource) and [DataMember](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XtraReportBase.DataMemeber) properties to assign the data source to the report.
